# mdlAppLogin
This is a Laravel front-end project. It will display a bootstrap login view and a registration view. 

It will return a JWT and optionally a unique key based on the following DB relationship: **User-Application-Release-Device**.

Typically this authentication approach will be used in mobile apps where registration and authentication occurs within a cross-domain iframe.
